            Ready to learn and have fun at the same time? Join us for a gamified course in event-driven
            development! ðŸŒŸ
        </p>
        <p>
            At Nav, we develop modern systems with an event-driven microservice architecture that
            meets future labour and welfare needs. Now we invite you to learn how we
            build applications that solve complex challenges.
        </p>

            <div class="leesah-kurs-image-container">
                <img src={leesahKurs1.src} alt="Leesah course"/>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            In the course, we will first introduce the key principles behind event-driven
            development. Then it's time for action: we start with a gamified workshop where you
            code in pairs. Together you will develop an application that connects to Kafka to handle
            challenges on an ongoing basis. This will be a fun and challenging afternoon full of coding
            and learning!
        </p>
        <p>
            Our trainers are experienced developers who work in different teams in Nav.
            They have varied backgrounds and expertise, and have designed this
            course to strengthen both their own and your expertise in event-driven development and
            programming.
        </p>

        <p>
            Who should attend? If you are curious about event-driven development and want to learn how we
            work in Nav, this course is for you! Some experience with Python, JavaScript, or Go, and
            programming in general is recommended, but you don't need to be an expert. Don't miss
            this unique opportunity to develop your skills in an interactive and fun
            setting! ðŸ’»ðŸ‘¾

            We run Leesah Game for universities, colleges, at conferences and at various
            companies.
            If you think this could be a fun course we can organise for you and your colleagues,
