            Leesah Game is a product of the strong focus on competence sharing in Nav IT.
            Leesah Game is organised as a professional group, which means that every other Thursday++ is set aside to work with Leesah Game.
            Leesah Game is conducted as courses internally in Nav IT, at universities, conferences and other agencies in the public sector.
            All in paid working hours!

                <p>
                    Other than that, it's all about knitting and an ambitious goal of completing as many Escape Rooms as possible before retirement.
