## Local Leesah

Local Leesah is the version we run remotely as part of Nav's recruitment efforts.
When you play the local version, we have built a separate library that you import into your code,
so that you only need certificates to talk to Kafka, and the library for your language.

### Get started

We have created libraries in several different languages, so just choose the one you like best.
Each library will have its own documentation on how to get started.

- [Python üêç](https://pypi.org/project/leesah-game/)
- [Go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/navikt/go-leesah)
- [JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@navikt/leesah-game)
